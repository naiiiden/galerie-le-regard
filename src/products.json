She was saved by a man named Miyagi Asojiro before the bandit was able to assault her. Then the two fell in love and Asojiro sent Miyuki a fan with poetry written on it expressing his love for her. This painting depicts Miyuki looking at the fan and thinking about her love Asojiro. Miyuki turns around, feeling that somebody is coming and she quickly hides the fan under her sleeve. Her behavior is typical of a young, naïve, woman falling in love. This is one of Shoen’s masterpiece works of the Taisho Era.",

Yoshida spent his life conveying images of Japan's landscape beauties, particularly those of its mountain scenery. This woodblock print fully reflects the devotion of his later life. This work was created in 1926, the second year after he began to print his own images, and he created a total of 41 works that year. It was the most productive year of his life. His second son who would later make a name for himself as a printmaker, was born that year and named after this mountain, Hodaka.",

    "description": "This familiar image was exhibited publicly for the first time at the Art Institute of Chicago, winning a three-hundred-dollar prize and instant fame for Grant Wood. The impetus for the painting came while Wood was visiting the small town of Eldon in his native Iowa. There he spotted a little wood farmhouse, with a single oversized window, made in a style called Carpenter Gothic. “I imagined American Gothic people with their faces stretched out long to go with this American Gothic house,” he said. He used his sister and his dentist as models for a farmer and his daughter, dressing them as if they were “tintypes from my old family album.” The highly detailed, polished style and the rigid frontality of the two figures were inspired by Flemish Renaissance art, which Wood studied during his travels to Europe between 1920 and 1926. After returning to settle in Iowa, he became increasingly appreciative of midwestern traditions and culture, which he celebrated in works such as this. American Gothic, often understood as a satirical comment on the midwestern character, quickly became one of America’s most famous paintings and is now firmly entrenched in the nation’s popular culture. Yet Wood intended it to be a positive statement about rural American values, an image of reassurance at a time of great dislocation and disillusionment. The man and woman, in their solid and well-crafted world, with all their strengths and weaknesses, represent survivors.",

Guiragossian's pieces move between abstraction and figuration to capture the essence of the human form. Guiragossian uses long, vertical brushstrokes to depict the bodies of his figures as abstracted and elongated so that the imagery has echoes of Byzantine icons. A true Modernist, Guiragossian began producing during the late sixties complete abstract paintings. Applying bright, bold color in blocks to the canvas, Guiragossian then left parts of the surface untouched, generating depth and movement through a creative embrace of negative space.",

In Man from Naples, the artist apparently regarded the entire surface of the canvas as a big blackboard where he could scribble and mix signs.

He copied and enlarged the Japanese figure by tracing on a grid, giving her a colorful kimono and placing her against a bright yellow background. The border around the figure is a unified whole. The watery landscape with bamboo canes, water lilies, frogs, cranes and, in the distance, a little boat – are all motifs Van Gogh borrowed from other Japanese prints. The choice of animals was certainly not accidental: in 19th century France, prostitutes were often referred to as grues (cranes) or grenouilles (frogs); they are a reference to the woman’s \"profession\". The Courtesan is not the only painting based on Japanese prints. Two other examples are Flowering plum orchard: after Hiroshige and The Bridge in the Rain, both after woodcuts by Utagawa Hiroshige from Van Gogh’s own collection.",

Schiele's use of colour is also on a par with his sensitive drawing. Striking features include the rich nuances of the skin and the light eye with the red pupil. In this portrait Schiele depicted himself as a sensitive person and artist.",

The shadow behind the couple gathers them in a pyramid-shaped composition so that they become one. The motif has had a number of titles. The first version was called Love and Pain when it was exhibited in Berlin in 1893. Many years later, in connection with the Frieze of Life exhibition in Kristiania in1918, Munch gave a new version of the motif the title Woman kissing Man on the Neck. All the same it is the title Vampire that we usually associate with the motif. It was probably the Polish poet and anarchist Stanislaw Przybyszewski, a central figure in Berlin’s artist circles, who chose the title Vampire for the motif!?",

A dusk setting provided ideal conditions for representing the chilly evening air for the Inatori Bay view depicted in this print. Hiroaki has constructed a triple play of light effects in this composition. First, the colour relations of the work are established in the bokashi transition from dark, inky blue in the upper sky, down through a play of yellows into intense orange on the horizon, shifting into a sea-blue that attracts the eye forward to the blue-grey wavelets of the foreground. This is complemented by the warm golden light of tiny junk windows and their reflections glowing on the water. The play is echoed again to the right, in the house lights and their reflections on the water in the middle distance.",

Samson’s terror is expressed in his heroic nakedness, embittered blood-streaked face, and hands that can smash stone. Since the Middle Ages, artists’ imaginations had been set on fire by the notion of “God’s Chosen One” who towered mightily above other human beings: as a prefiguration of Christ, as a counterpart to Hercules, and as an image of the tragedy of the hero who pays for his untrammeled sensuality with his eyesight. The Blinded Samson is Corinth’s third and last treatment of this theme. As a reaction to the stroke which threatened the artist’s life in December 1911, it steps completely outside the traditional boundaries of its genre and finally shakes off the spell cast by the earlier example of Rembrandt. In this vision of the impending act of breaking free, which will destroy both Samson and his enemies, the painting becomes a drama of life and death.",

    "description": "With Manet's assistance, Monet found lodging in suburban Argenteuil in late 1871, a move that initiated one of the most fertile phases of his career. Impressionism evolved in the late 1860s from a desire to create full–scale, multi–figure depictions of ordinary people in casual outdoor situations. At its purest, impressionism was attuned to landscape painting, a subject Monet favored. In Woman with a Parasol – Madame Monet and Her Son, his skill as a figure painter is equally evident. Contrary to the artificial conventions of academic portraiture, Monet delineated the features of his sitters as freely as their surroundings. The spontaneity and naturalness of the resulting image were praised when it appeared in the second impressionist exhibition in 1876. Woman with a Parasol was painted outdoors, probably in a single session of several hours' duration. The artist intended the work to convey the feeling of a casual family outing rather than a formal portrait, and used pose and placement to suggest that his wife and son interrupted their stroll while he captured their likenesses. The brevity of the moment portrayed here is conveyed by a repertory of animated brushstrokes of vibrant color, hallmarks of the style Monet was instrumental in forming. Bright sunlight shines from behind Camille to whiten the top of her parasol and the flowing cloth at her back, while colored reflections from the wildflowers below touch her front with yellow.",

A famous piece, it had a huge impact on French artists in the 19th century. The movement of the curves and counter-curves of the wave depicted by the artist evokes a dynamic catastrophe. In the pure Japanese sense, it also depicts the fragile character of human life when faced with the forces of nature. Mount Fuji is not usually noticed upon first glance. In the crux of the wave, its dimension is reduced from afar, on an extremely low horizon. Hokusai borrowed this perspective from the Western style. The point of view, close to that of the fishermen, serves to make the wave appear more menacing. Having received artistic training at the Ukiyo-e, Hokusai gradually tired of traditional subjects, preferring to spend more time on landscapes. In the minimalist palette, we can note an artificial pigment, devised in Germany in 1709, called Prussian Blue , which was admired for its intensity.",

A lantern, suspended from a palmette canopy centered in the ceiling, is designed in a large circular fish scale pattern. The black japannned and cane furniture is typical of the Victorian period. The floor covering appears to simulate tatami matting. Two large seated statues in costume flank French doors on the right. A mysterious seated figure in the left foreground holds a mask to his face with one hand; an unidentified object, perhaps also a mask, is in the other hand.",

At the center of the composition, one can distinguish the profile of Moses suggested with some white lines that appear to be the result of an instantaneous, unpremeditated impulse. This same color not only envelops the gigantic tablets of the law, but extend around the prophet’s profile in the form of expressive drips and drops. The tablets also contain a series of inscriptions in an arrangement that looks more orderly and contained, unlike the one in Man from Naples. This work obviously alludes to a biblical episode that can also be related to the history of Africa.",

The form of the cat is reminiscent of one painted by the Chinese Song dynasty emperor Huizong, and this stimulated Seihô's desire to paint the animal. So he brought the cat back to Kyoto with him and observed the cat playing in his studio night and day, carefully sketching to create this image. The lack of background, and the green stare of the cat, looking at the viewer as he licks his back, is particularly impressive. The soft texture of the cat's fur, rendered in black ink, gofun (oyster shell white) and gold paint is so realistic it almost appears touchable. A single cat is placed almost in the center of the page, against a blank background. The signature appears on the other end of the diagonal axis that runs through the cat’s extended front leg, a carefully considered compositional ploy. Seihô saw the cat at a vegetable shop on his travels in Numazu, and in that instant thought of the cat painting by the Song emperor Huizong and was struck by a desire to paint him. Exchanging the cat for one of his own paintings, Seihô returned with the cat to Kyoto where he photographed and sketched the cat repeatedly until he set upon the completion of this work. The soft and silky fur is rendered in layered strokes of black ink and ochre, with further hairs added in ink and gofun (oyster shell white), while the eyes were drawn in azurite, malachite and gold powder.",

The motif is one of a number of Munch’s portrayals of sickness, death and sorrow in the family. In the sparsely furnished room the artist has painted himself together with his closest family - his brother, sisters, father and aunt. His 15-year-old sister is sitting in a chair with the back of the chair facing us. Munch: Her last request was to get up out of the bed and sit in a chair. “I so much want to live”, she said, “I think we have such good times together”. But in that chair Sophie died… In the picture, which Munch also called The Moment of Death, all the family members are portrayed at the ages they were when the motif was painted in 1893. It could be that Munch did this in order to express a dimension of contemporaneity – that the family would for ever be marked by the death of Sophie. The large separated colour surfaces and the simplified forms limited by clear contours show ties with symbolism and synthetism and Paul Gauguin. Munch painted two versions of Death in the Sickroom. Both paintings are to be found Oslo – one in the National Gallery and this one in the Munch Museum.",

In the engineering marvel of the Brooklyn Bridge, which he first depicted in 1918 and returned to throughout his career, he found a contemporary technological monument that embodied the modern human spirit. Here, Stella portrays the bridge with a linear dynamism borrowed from Italian Futurism. He captures the dizzying height and awesome scale of the bridge from a series of fractured perspectives, combining dramatic views of radiating cables, stone masonry, cityscapes, and night sky. The large scale of the work—it is nearly six feet tall—conjures a Renaissance altar, while the Gothic style of the massive pointed arches evokes medieval churches. By combining contemporary architecture and historical allusions, Stella transformed the Brooklyn Bridge into a twentieth-century symbol of divinity, the quintessence of modern life and the Machine Age.",

It undoubtedly represents the culmination of the phase known as the “Golden Epoch”. In this decade, the artist created a puzzling, ornamental encoded programme that revolved around the mystery of existence, love and fulfilment through art. Klimt gained initial inspiration for this in 1903 on a journey to Ravenna to see the Byzantine mosaics. In addition, the painting contains a myriad of motifs from various cultural epochs, above all from Ancient Egyptian mythology. Most recent research has, however, revealed that it is not enough to read the ornaments in the picture just as symbols rooted in tradition aiming to convey a timelessly valid message. They reveal more, such as references to Klimt’s love for Emilie Flöge and the artist’s exploration of the sculptor Auguste Rodin’s art.",

Eva Mudocci was a famous British violinist who, together with the pianist Bella Edwards, had concert tours throughout Europe, including Norway. Edward Munch met her in Paris in 1903. The two of them became close friends. Initially the relationship was of an erotic nature, but in time became more like a brother-and-sister relationship. From 1902 to 1908 she was one of Munch’s closest confidantes. Munch himself called the lithograph Madonna and Madonna with Brooch, connecting it to the Madonna motif from the 1890s, but the Madonna- motif’s clearly sexual contents t have been reduced in this portrait to undertones in a beautiful and soulful face. Mudocci became an ideal figure and a muse for the artist, and this portrait, with its lyrical atmosphere and musical rhythms is undoubtedly one of the finest of Munch’s many female portraits. The portrait is nowadays best known as The.Brooch. Acting here as an eye-catcher in the composition, the brooch was a gift from the Norwegian art historian Jens Thiis in 1901.",
