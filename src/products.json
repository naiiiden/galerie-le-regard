This is a work that, while making use of the division of labor of painters, sculptors, and printers based on ukiyo-e tradition, aimed for the creation of a new style of woodblock printing, featuring cooperation between the publisher and three parties to realize the creative intentions of the artist. It was one of the starting points for modern woodblock printing. The highly dignified female image is something that only Goyô could have produced.",

    "description": "Qualities of colour, light, and atmosphere, a constant in Japanese printmaking, also fascinated Hiroaki (Shotei) Takahashi (1871-1945). For some designs, he varied the pigments, bokashi, and block combinations in otherwise identical landscape compositions to explore the atmospherics of different seasons or times of day. A dusk setting provided ideal conditions for representing the chilly evening air for the Inatori Bay view depicted in this print. Hiroaki has constructed a triple play of light effects in this composition. First, the colour relations of the work are established in the bokashi transition from dark, inky blue in the upper sky, down through a play of yellows into intense orange on the horizon, shifting into a sea-blue that attracts the eye forward to the blue-grey wavelets of the foreground. This is complemented by the warm golden light of tiny junk windows and their reflections glowing on the water. The play is echoed again to the right, in the house lights and their reflections on the water in the middle distance.",

He was also the representative painter of the conservative western-style painters, in the dichotomy of conservative and progressive camps which developed in Japan. He stood in opposition to Kuroda Seiki, leader of the Hakubakai group of weatern-style painters, and was active as one of the founding members of the Taiheiyougakai painting group. Throughout his life Yoshida sought to depict the beauty of Japan's landscapes, especially her mountainscapes. This work, created when Yoshida was just 34 years old and just as he was selected a juror of the 4th Bunten, conveys this artist's entire soul and is the greatest masterpiece of his early period. The art critics of the day made the following laudatory remarks when this work was displayed, \"The organization of color tones and the sound brushwork all bring a sense of pure joy to Rapids. In this work we can perceive an array of quiet and richly nuanced realism, from the water color to the crags, to their sheer combination. ... Clearly the breadth of his artistic vision is worthy of considerable attention.\"",

He based his painting on a work by the Japanese artist Kesai Eisen, which had been used for the cover of a special number of the magazine Paris Illustré. He copied and enlarged the Japanese figure by tracing on a grid, giving her a colorful kimono and placing her against a bright yellow background. The border around the figure is a unified whole. The watery landscape with bamboo canes, water lilies, frogs, cranes and, in the distance, a little boat – are all motifs Van Gogh borrowed from other Japanese prints. The choice of animals was certainly not accidental: in 19th century France, prostitutes were often referred to as grues (cranes) or grenouilles (frogs); they are a reference to the woman’s \"profession\". The Courtesan is not the only painting based on Japanese prints. Two other examples are Flowering plum orchard: after Hiroshige and The Bridge in the Rain, both after woodcuts by Utagawa Hiroshige from Van Gogh’s own collection.",

In On the Thames, A Heron, one of his first English works, Tissot created a successful amalgam of these two aesthetics by serving up to British tastes his French technique wrapped in the sweet Victorian charm of beautiful young women boating on the Thames. Also presented here is the artist's full comprehension of the aesthetics of Japanese design in his use of a high vantage point and the juxtaposition of two separate pictorial elements in compressed space. Further the instantaneous realism and framing of the composition also suggests the influence of photography.",

The woman points her umbrella imperiously in the direction of Trafalgar Square while her oblivious companion consults a guidebook. Meanwhile, a young guide from Christ's Hospital School stands by, bored, his services unengaged. The painting seems a straightforward, rather humorous look at sightseers in London. But is there more going on here? The woman breaks some important Victorian social rules. Her dress is too ostentatious for a day spent touring the city. Furthermore, her forthright gaze--apparently locking eyes with someone on the steps (or with the viewer of the painting)--is a breach of feminine propriety. A proper Victorian lady never made eye contact with strangers. The abandoned cigar on the steps provocatively suggests an unseen male presence. French artist James Tissot moved to London in 1872. A keen observer of the fashion and manners of the newly wealthy British middle class, many of his paintings suggest narratives of social \"mistakes,\" both innocent and deliberate.",

The identity of the father clinging so morosely to his child is not known. They may simply have been models. The setting, however, can be identified as the garden of Tissot's London residence in St John's Wood, a property that later passed to his colleague, the 'olympian' painter Alma-Tadema. 'The widower' has the moralising overtones of a Victorian problem picture, and it may be to the English taste for such images that Tissot was deliberately appealing. His liaison with a divorcee - a woman he frequently painted and clearly adored - placed him beyond the pale of conventional society, and beyond its patronage. It is almost tempting to see Tissot himself as the widower of the title, a man unhappily denied his mate. Technically, the work is an exercise in painterly probity: Tissot's rendering of vegetation, fabric and flesh is impressive. AGNSW Handbook, 1999.",

In Man from Naples, the artist apparently regarded the entire surface of the canvas as a big blackboard where he could scribble and mix signs.

This painting is a real climax in his treatment of this theme. Sensual, direct and dynamic, it defies all taboos. The picture represents a scene of modern, urban life and is constructed of large colour planes which both contrast and merge together. It was probably painted in 1908 but Kirchner returned to it in 1920, bringing new insights to bear by filling in originally unpainted areas with bright hues.",

Although the complementary colours red and blue apparently designate the opponent’s moves, the winner of the match is clear: the red ‘super-king’ has just felled the last of the opponent’s pieces. Whether Klee intended a reference to the totalitarian ferment of the late 1930s is unknown. What is certain, however, is that the National Socialists decried Klee’s art as ‘degenerate’ and confiscated over one hundred works from German museums in the year in which the picture was created. As early as 1933, the regime forced Klee to abandon his teaching post, whereupon he returned to Bern.",

Since 1989 it has been replaced in the narrow stairwell by a copy by Paul Pfister. It depicts the foundation of the Swiss Confederation by the legendary oath of three men from Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden. Preliminary drawings in the Graphic Art Collection (Gert Schiff: Johann Heinrich Füssli 1741-1825, 2 vols. (Zurich et al. 1973; = Oeuvrekataloge Schweizer Künstler 1), no. 412) and in Weimar (Stiftung Weimarer Klassik und Kunstsammlungen; Gert Schiff: Johann Heinrich Füssli 1741-1825, 2 vols. (Zurich et al. 1973; = Oeuvrekataloge Schweizer Künstler 1), no. 411). One oil study has been rediscovered more recently (The Art Institute of Chicago, inv. 1980.170, see Frederick N. Bohrer: Public virtue and private terror: A two-sided oil sketch by Henry Fuseli (Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte 53, 1990/1)). Engraved by Franz Hegi: 'Der Schweizerbund', 1807-1809 (see David H. Weinglass: Prints and engraved Illustrations by and after Henry Fuseli. A catalogue raisonné (Aldershot 1994), no. 282).",

    "description": "De Loutherbourg was born in Strasbourg, but moved with his family to Paris in 1755. He exhibited at the Paris salon from 1762. His works were mainly either landscapes inspired by Dutch 17th-century prototypes or romanticised shipwrecks which continue the tradition of Claude-Joseph Vernet (1714-1789). He also painted pictures of bandits recalling the style of Salvator Rosa. He moved to London in November 1771 where he worked as a stage designer at the Drury Lane theatre for David Garrick and subsequently for Richard Brinsley Sheridan. He is recognised as the most inventive and influential stage designer active Europe during the eighteenth century. He continued to paint landscapes in England, his work tending to become more topographical. He subsequently turned to Biblical subjects where his sense of the dramatic find expression in scenes of terrfiying chaos, works which 'made a profound impression on J.M.W. Turner and John Martin'.",

    "description": "Painted two years after the famous The Nightmare, this work can be considered one of the greatest of his early works. Füssli frequently quoted from the works of such British authors as Shakespeare, and this work draws its inspiration from Dryden's poem Theodore and Honoria, an adaptation of the \"Story of Nastagio degli Onesti\" from Boccacio's Decameron. The scene from Theodore and Honoria, shown here, recounts the story of Theodore, a young man from Ravenna, who, spurned by a cool reception from his beloved Honoria, sets out to walk through the forests on the edge of Ravenna. There he meets the specter of the suicide Guido Cavalcanti, who had also been coolly received by his lover. Guido sets ferocious dogs to attack his naked, fleeing lover. Here Füssli turns to the story by Boccacio that was the basis for Dryden's poem, creating a particularly striking image through Dryden's heightened drama and the use of solid figural types that were based on his study of antique sculpture. This work was created under a commission from the third Earl of Orford, George Walpole, for the decoration of his Norfolk estate, Horton Hall. It descended through the generations of the family, and was kept at Horton Hall until recent years. (Source: Masterpieces of the National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo, 2009, cat. no.57)",

    "description": "The mythological tale depicted in this painting comes from the Icelandic sagas of the Edda, which were known in England from P. H. Mallet’s 1770 book Northern Antiquities. Here, Fuseli depicts Thor rowing out in a boat with the giant Hymir (shown crouching at the back of the boat), watched by the elderly god Odin in the top left corner. Using an ox’s head as bait, Thor manages to fish up the Serpent of Midgard and challenges the creature to a fight. Parallels have been drawn between this epic struggle and the contemporaneous revolution in France, which Fuseli enthusiastically supported. Thor’s battle with the serpent could be seen to mirror the French people’s struggle against the ancien régime",

    "description": "Claude-Joseph Vernet depicted a storm's aftermath: dark clouds above an angry sea, a shipwrecked boat and its anxious survivors, and listing ships in the distance. As the sea furiously beats against the shoreline, waves explode beyond the rocks in a froth of white. The motion of the waves, the distant rain shaft, the battered ship, and even the bodies of the fleeing castaways fill the scene with strong, opposing diagonal lines. The lighthouse standing solidly upright at the painting's center counters all of this activity. The strong colors of the shipwrecked survivors' clothing stand out against the palette of greens, grays, and browns in the turbulent sea. Clearing skies cast the survivors in an eerie glow; dark tones at the left and lower edges and in the waves themselves draw further attention to the bright figures. The scene as a whole suggests the powerful force of nature over man. Vernet's companion piece for this painting, A Calm at a Mediterranean Port, presents a sharply contrasting scene of a harbor in more placid weather.",

He depicts several characters on the quayside, including some who are wearing Turkish garments, evoking the trade with the East. In his composition, he grants more space to the port than the sea, in order to better detail, in the foreground, the products and business which resulted from the maritime trade, which was Marseilles' principal activity. Although it shows a real location, the depiction idealises the power of French maritime.",
